"""
Text analysis utilities for AI Habit Coach.

This module:
- Instantiates a Hugging Face 'sentiment-analysis' pipeline (DistilBERT).
- Provides analyze_text(text) that returns sentiment label/score and
  a small heuristic 'motivation_score' plus keywords for personalization.

Why:
- Using a pretrained model speeds development and provides robust results
  for short text entries typical of a user's journal.

    Return a singleton sentiment-analysis pipeline.

def analyze_text(text):
    """
    Analyze the input text and return a structured dict with:
      - label: "POSITIVE" or "NEGATIVE"
      - score: confidence of the label (0..1)
      - valence: numeric sentiment [0..1], where larger is more positive
      - motivation_score: heuristic [0..1] that detects activity-related words
      - keywords: list of found motivational keywords

    Why:
    - Valence gives a numeric signal for fusion with face emotion.
    - Motivation_score helps produce tailored advice when the user mentions goals.
